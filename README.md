## Project Purpose:

This game was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 10.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/rahul-rajabhoj/reactnd-myreads.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```
